- Add some kind of boilerplate template for projects file; make it easier to just add in new projects.
- Do the same for course schedule. Also need to automate loading them into +page.svelte.
- Dark Mode toggle button.
- Figure out how to align bullet points properly.
- Add Gallery page with pictures. Gundams?!
