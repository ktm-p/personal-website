                The goal of this project was to use numerical methods to solve a double pendulum system in MATLAB.

                For the project, I set up the system of equation needed and used Newton's Method in order to find an expression for the root of the function. Then, after implementing a Backwards Euler method, I solved the system using both Backwards Euler and RK4 and compared the results.

                Finally, I also explored some properties and results, such as approximating the number of iterations needed to solve the equation, and analyzing the stability of Backwards Euler.
