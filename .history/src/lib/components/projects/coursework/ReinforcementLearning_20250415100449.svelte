                In this project, I trained Pac-Man using Reinforcement Learning so that he can win. In order to do this, I implemented value iteration, Q-Learning, Approximate Q-Learning, and Deep Q-Learning with PyTorch. I also coded up the Epsilon-Greedy action selection for Pac-Man's policy.
                <br><br>
                For Deep Q-Learning, I implemented it using a five-layer Linear Neural Network which uses the ReLU activation function and Mean Square Error loss. Through this, I achieved over an approximately 90% winrate with my Pac-Man agent.
                <br><br>
                Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of PyTorch, along with how to finetune hyperparameters such as the learning rate, batch and hidden layer sizes, and the number of training episodes.
