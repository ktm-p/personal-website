                Build Your Own World (BYOW) is a 2D game where the user tries to collect a key and escape from the maze.
                <br><br>
                The game features a pseudo-random world generation system made using Prim's Algorithm. It also has a playable, customizable character, a lighting system made with BFS, limited vision that prevents the user from seeing past walls, and enemies with pathfinding AI implemented using A*-search. Furthermore, there is a save feature, allowing players to save and reload their progress.
