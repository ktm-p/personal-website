                In this project, I designed a secure file sharing system which used cryptographic library functions, and then implemented it in Golang.
                <br><br>
                As part of the design process, I had to figure out how to implement the sharing system. Then, I had to determine possible vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit to execute malicious actions. Furthermore, I had to ensure that my code had the functionalities required of a file sharing system. This was accomplished through over three thousand lines of testing code, including fuzz testing as well to handle possible edge cases I may have missed.
                <br><br>                        
                In order to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of user data, I used symmetric encryption, HMACs, and digital signatures.
