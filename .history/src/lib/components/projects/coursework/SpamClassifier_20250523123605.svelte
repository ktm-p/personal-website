                The goal of this project was to implement a filter that detected whether or not an email was classified as spam or ham using a Logistic Regression model.

                For the project, I had to clean up the dataset and filter out all of the noisy data, analyze the relationship between possible features and their class in order to determine the features to be used, and also extract key information from emails.

                Finally, in order to finetune the hyperparameters of my model, I used GridSearchCV. Ultimately, I created a model that yielded an accuracy of around 99.2% on the testing data provided.
