            <p>
                Over the course of this project, I learned to use PyTorch on a variety of machine learning problems, ranging from approximating a sinusoidal curve to digit recognition and language detection.
                <br><br>
                For recognizing digits, I initially implemented a two-layer Linear Neural Network with a ReLU activation function and Cross-Entropy loss. Later on, I implemented a Convolutional Layer as well to take into account things such as spatial features of the image, and then flattened it down. Ultimately, my model achieved an accuracy of over 98%.
