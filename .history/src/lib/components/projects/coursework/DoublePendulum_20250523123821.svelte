                The goal of this project was to use numerical methods to solve a double pendulum system in MATLAB.

                For the project, I set up the system of equation needed and used Newton's Method in order to find an expression for the root of the function. Then, after implementing Backwards Euler and RK4 methods, I solved the system using both and compared the results.

                Finally, I explored the results further, such as approximating the number of iterations needed to solve the equation, and analyzing the stability of Backwards Euler.
