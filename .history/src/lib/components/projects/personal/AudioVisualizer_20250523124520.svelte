                The Audio Visualizer utilizes the FFT Algorithm to convert audio into frequency-domain information, along with a 3D Terrain generation system with Perlin Noise.

                Using FFT, I created graphics that were responsive to the audio being played. This includes 3D objects which move according to the different frequencies of the audio, along with a fluctuating polar graph representation in the background. Finally, at the bottom of the screen is a 3D Terrain made using Perlin Noise that's responsive to the audio.
