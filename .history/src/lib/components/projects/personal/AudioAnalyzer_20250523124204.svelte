                This is an Audio Analyzer program I wrote using Processing. Users can play a desired MP3 audio file and see graphical representations of certain information. This includes the Audio Waveform and its Polar Graph representation, the Discrete Fourier Transform of the audio, the audio's level, and also its beat.

                For the project, I implemented the RDFT Algorithm, smoothed it, and also created the different graphical representations for the audio. Beat detection was implemented by comparing the current audio's level to previous ones in the stack.
