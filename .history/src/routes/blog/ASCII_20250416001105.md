# Introduction
If you've spent any time browsing the internet back in the early 2000's to 2010's, you've probably come across a number of ASCII images. While some images are simple and can probably be reconstructed by-hand, a lot of them are incredibly complex; I mean, there's no way somebody sat there and manually typed out something like the Mona Lisa, right?

Obviously not.

Clearly, there was some programming to convert these images into ASCII. Thus, curious about this process, I decided to tinker around and build my own ASCII converter.

For the rest of this post, I'll be detailing how I went about creating an ASCII converter, along with further improvements and optimizations done to the na&iumlve implementation.
