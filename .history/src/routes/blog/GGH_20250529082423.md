# Introduction
Recently, I wrote a paper on a topic of interest for my Cryptography course. Seeing how present cryptosystems rely on the hardness of problems such as factoring and discrete-logarithm, both of which are cracked by Shor's algorithms, I decided to investigate (attempts at) Post-Quantum Cryptography. In particular, I explored an early lattice-based cryptosystem known as the Goldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi (GGH) Encryption Scheme. The paper can be read here.

Continuing from my paper, in this blog post I'll expand on it and implement both the cryptosystem itself, along with various attacks on it.

# Background
To begin with, we will provide a quick recap of relevant concepts for the cryptosystem. First, we need to understand the notion of a "lattice" -- after all, this is what the entire cryptosystem relies on for its security!

We define an $n$-dimensional lattice $\mathcal{L}$ to be an integer linear combination of vectors:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L} = \left\{ \alpha_1v_1 + \cdots + \alpha_nv_n : \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}
\end{equation*}
$$

The set of linearly independent vectors which spans our lattice is called the basis. Note that $\mathcal L$ can have infinitely many bases! With this idea of bases, a natural question to ask is how we can differentiate between them. This is where the Hadamard Ratio comes in, which gives us a way to quantify the orthogonality of a chosen basis of $\mathcal L$:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal H(B) = \pr{ \frac{\det \mathcal L}{\norm{v_1} \cdots \norm{v_n}} }^{1/n}
\end{equation*}
$$

Now, ...
