# Introduction
If you've spent any time browsing the internet back in the early 2000's, you've probably come across a number of ASCII images. While some images are simple and can probably be reconstructed by hand, others are incredibly complex; I mean, there's no way somebody sat there and manually typed out something like the Mona Lisa, right?

Obviously not -- clearly, there was some programming to convert these images into ASCII. Thus, curious about this process, I decided to tinker around and build my own ASCII converter.

For the rest of this post, I'll be detailing how I went about creating an ASCII converter, along with further improvements and optimizations done to the na&iumlve implementation. This includes adding in colour, speeding up the implementation, and also introducing edge detection to further refine the output.

# The Basic Idea
The core idea is that we want to replace each pixel in our image with an ASCII character. 

The question then is what feature of the pixels do we want each character to convey. One natural choice is to try conveying the ``intensity" of a pixel -- that is, how bright a pixel is. We can extract this intensity $Y$ by converting our image to a grayscale version of itself using the following formula:

$$
Y = 0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B
$$

For my na&iumlve implementation, I'll be using the following ten characters:
```python
ASCII_LIST = [" ", ".", ":", "c", "o", "P", "O", "?", "@", "â– "]
```

The characters here are listed in ascending order of how intense they are. This was done by just eyeballing how much blank space there is for the characters -- the less, the brighter.

However, we now have an issue: there are way more intensity values than there are ASCII characters! The solution then is that we can construct bins to place our intensity values into. In our case, since we have ten ASCII characters, we can create ten equally-sized bins and map brightness values that falls within each bin to their corresponding ASCII character.

## Implementation
With all of that in mind, we can begin coding this up in Python. First, we will define a `grayscale()` function that takes in an iamge and grayscale it. This can be done simply using the `PIL` library:

```python
def grayscale(image: PIL.Image.Image) -> PIL.Image.Image:
    return image.convert("L")
```

Now, we want to actually extract our image given an image path, and then use our `grayscale()` function that we wrote to extract the intensity of each pixel:
```python
path = input("Enter a valid path to an image:\n")
try:
    image = PIL.Image.open(path)
except:
    print("Error opening image.")
    return

grayscaled_image = grayscale(image)
```

With our grayscaled image, we are now ready to convert it into an ASCII picture. The steps are as follows:
- First, we will get the pixel data for our grayscaled image using `image.getdata()`.
- Now, we iterate through each pixel, looking at their intensity.
    - Since $Y \in [0, 255]$, we will first scale it down so that we have $Y \in [0, 1]$. This can be done by dividing a pixel's brightness value by $255$.
- Next, we assign the pixel to their corresponding bucket using the following equation:
$$
\max\left\{0, \lfloor Y \times \texttt{len(ASCII\_LIST)}\rfloor - 1\right\}
$$
- We append each of these characters to a list `asciified` representing our ASCII image.
- Finally, we iterate through this list, adding in line breaks as necessary.

In code, this would look something like:
```python
pixels = image.getdata()
asciified = []

for pixel in pixels:
    luminance = pixel / 255
    bucket = max(math.floor(luminance * len(ASCII_LIST)) - 1, 0)
    asciified.append(ASCII_LIST[bucket])
    
characters = "".join(asciified)
ascii = "\n".join(characters[i:(i + image.width)] for i in range(0, len(characters), image.width))
```
