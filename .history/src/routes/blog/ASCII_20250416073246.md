# Introduction
If you've spent any time browsing the internet back in the early 2000's, you've probably come across a number of ASCII images. While some images are simple and can probably be reconstructed by hand, others are incredibly complex; I mean, there's no way somebody sat there and manually typed out something like the Mona Lisa, right?

Obviously not -- clearly, there was some programming to convert these images into ASCII. Thus, curious about this process, I decided to tinker around and build my own ASCII converter.

For the rest of this post, I'll be detailing how I went about creating an ASCII converter, along with further improvements and optimizations done to the na&iumlve implementation. This includes adding in colour, speeding up the implementation, and also introducing edge detection to further refine the output.

# The Basic Idea
The core idea is that we want to replace each pixel in our image with an ASCII character. 

The question then is what feature of the pixels do we want each character to convey. One natural choice is to try conveying the ``intensity" of a pixel -- that is, how bright a pixel is. We can extract this intensity $Y$ by converting our image to a grayscale version of itself using the following formula:

$$
Y = 0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B
$$

For my na&iumlve implementation, I'll be using the following ten characters:
```python
ASCII_LIST = [" ", ".", ":", "c", "o", "P", "O", "?", "@", "■"]
```

The characters here are listed in ascending order of how intense they are. This was done by just eyeballing how little blank space there is for the characters; this means that a space has no brightness, while the ■ character has maximum brightness. However, we now have an issue: there are way more luminance values than there are ASCII characters!

Now, with that in mind, we can code this up in Python. First, we want to 

```python
