# Introduction
Recently, I wrote a paper on a topic of interest for my Cryptography course. Seeing how present cryptosystems rely on the hardness of problems such as factoring and discrete-logarithm, both of which are cracked by Shor's algorithms, I decided to investigate (attempts at) Post-Quantum Cryptography. In particular, I explored an early lattice-based cryptosystem known as the Goldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi (GGH) Encryption Scheme. The paper can be read here.

Continuing from my paper, in this blog post I'll expand on it and implement both the cryptosystem itself, along with various attacks on it.

# Background
Before we dive into the implementation, we will provide a quick recap of relevant concepts for the cryptosystem along with the high-level overview of the scheme itself.

## Mathematical Prerequisites
First, we need to understand the notion of a "lattice" -- after all, this is what the entire cryptosystem relies on for its security! Here, we define an $n$-dimensional lattice $\mathcal{L}$ to be an integer linear combination of vectors:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L} = \left\{ \alpha_1v_1 + \cdots + \alpha_nv_n : \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}
\end{equation*}
$$

Another way to think of lattices is in terms of groups. Under a more group-theoretic perspective, lattices can be thought of as a group $\mathcal L$ satisfying the following two properties:
- Additive Subgroup
- Discrete: For each $g \in \mathcal L$, there exists an $\varepsilon$-neighborhood around them where there exists no other points.

Now, we call the set of linearly independent vectors which spans our lattice the basis. Notice that $\mathcal L$ can have infinitely many bases!

With this idea of bases, a natural question to ask is how we can differentiate between them. This is where the Hadamard Ratio comes in, which gives us a way to quantify the orthogonality of a chosen basis of $\mathcal L$:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal H(B) = \left( \frac{\det \mathcal L}{\lVert v_1\rVert \cdots \lvert v_n\rvert} \right)^{1/n}
\end{equation*}
$$

The closer this ratio is to $1$, the more orthogonal our basis is. From the figure above, we see that for our example lattice $\mathcal L$, the basis $\left\{u_1, u_2 \right\}$ is more orthogonal than $\left\{v_1, v_2 \right\}$; i.e. the
