# Introduction
Recently, I had to write a paper <sup><i class='fas fa-external-link-alt arrow'></i></sup> on a topic of interest for cryptography. Seeing how present cryptosystems rely on the hardness of problems such as factoring and discrete-logarithm, both of which are weak to Quantum Computers, I decided to investigate (attempts at) Post-Quantum Cryptography. In particular, I explored an early lattice-based cryptosystem known as the Goldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi (GGH) Encryption Scheme.

Continuing on from my paper, in this blog post I'll be implementing both the cryptosystem itself, along with various attacks on it.

# Background
Before we dive into the implementation, we will provide a quick recap of relevant concepts for the cryptosystem along with the high-level overview of the scheme itself.

## Mathematical Prerequisites
First, we need to understand the notion of a "lattice" -- after all, this is what the entire cryptosystem relies on for its security! Here, we define an $n$-dimensional **lattice** $\mathcal{L}$ to be an integer linear combination of vectors:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L} = \left\{ \alpha_1v_1 + \cdots + \alpha_nv_n : \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}
\end{equation*}
$$

Another way to think of lattices is in terms of groups. Under a more group-theoretic perspective, lattices can be thought of as a group $\mathcal L$ satisfying the following two properties:
- **Additive Subgroup**
- **Discrete**: For each $g \in \mathcal L$, there exists an $\varepsilon$-neighborhood around them where there exists no other points.

Now, we call the set of linearly independent vectors which spans our lattice the **basis**. Notice that $\mathcal L$ can have infinitely many bases! An example of a lattice in the Euclidean plane can be seen below:

![Lattice in the Euclidean Plane](/blog/ggh/fig_1.svg "Figure 1: Lattice in the Euclidean Plane")

With this idea of bases, a natural question to ask is how we can differentiate between them. This is where the Hadamard Ratio comes in, which gives us a way to quantify the orthogonality of a chosen basis of $\mathcal L$:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal H(B) = \left( \frac{\det \mathcal L}{\lVert v_1\rVert \cdots \lvert v_n\rvert} \right)^{1/n}
\end{equation*}
$$

The closer this ratio is to $1$, the more orthogonal our basis is. From the figure above, we see that for our example lattice $\mathcal L$, the basis $\left\{u_1, u_2 \right\}$ is more orthogonal than $\left\{v_1, v_2 \right\}$; i.e. the Hadamard Ratio of the former basis is higher than the latter.

The last key idea related to different lattice bases is that of **unimodular matrices**. A unimodular matrix $U$ is defined as a matrix with integer-valued entries with a determinant of $\pm 1$. As it turns out, for some unimodular matrix $U$ and basis $B$ of a lattice $\mathcal L$, the product $UB$ is also a basis for $\mathcal L$; the operation preserves the underlying lattice structure. Intuitively, we can think of unimodular matrices as acting like a change-of-basis matrix.

## The Closest Vector Problem
With all of the mathematical prerequisites laid out, we can now discuss the crux of GGH's security: the **Closest Vector Problem** (CVP). Loosely speaking, the idea is that, given a lattice $\mathcal L$ and some arbitrary vector $v \in V$ (not necessarily part of our lattice), we want to find the closest lattice point to said vector.

![Example of CVP Instance](/blog/ggh/fig_2.png "Figure 2: Example of CVP Instance")

As it turns out, without knowing extra information like the basis of $\mathcal L$, it is very difficult to find this closest vector point! However, there exists algorithms that approximate CVP (such as **Babai's Rounding Technique**) if the basis we work with is orthogonal enough (i.e. it has a high Hadamard Ratio). As such, it is clear how this could serve as the starting point for an encryption scheme.

## The GGH Encryption Scheme
With all of this in mind, we now have the ingredients for the GGH Cryptosystem. First, we need to decide on the dimension $N$ of our lattice $\mathcal L$ and the ``noise parameter" $\sigma$. Both of these values are pre-determined and public. In the original paper, the creators of GGH conjectured that a value of $N > 300$ and $\sigma = 3$ was sufficiently secure.

Next, since GGH is an asymmetric encryption method, we need a private and public key. For our private key, we will use a randomly-generated basis $K_{\mathrm{priv}}$ that has a high Hadamard Ratio (i.e. it is nearly orthogonal). This allows us to solve for CVP easily using methods like the aforementioned rounding technique.

For our public key, we can create a basis with a low Hadamard Ratio for our lattice by constructing some unimodular matrix $U$ and then constucting:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    K_{\mathrm{pub}} = UK_{\mathrm{priv}}
\end{equation*}
$$

Because this basis has a low Hadamard Ratio, the rounding technique fails, and thus attackers -- without knowing our private key -- can't decrypt our message.

From here, we describe the encryption and decryption process. For encryption, we will have an $N$-dimensional message vector $m$, whose entries are all integers. Next, we randomly generate a noise vector $e$, where each entry is picked randomly from the set $\left\{-\sigma, \sigma\right\}$. Then, we define our ciphertext $c$ as follows:
$$
\begin{equation*}
    c = mK_{\mathrm{pub}} + e
\end{equation*}
$$

For the decryption process, suppose we've received some encrypted message $c$. Because we have knowledge of $K_{\mathrm{priv}}$ which has a high Hadamard Ratio, we can apply the rounding technique with this basis to eliminate the noise $e$. This yields us
$$
\begin{align*}
    c' &= mK_{\mathrm{pub}} \\
    &= mUK_{\mathrm{priv}}
\end{align*}
$$

From here, we can calculate the inverses of $K_{\mathrm{priv}}$ and $U$. Then, by right-multiplying, we get:
$$
\begin{align*}
    mUK_{\mathrm{priv}}K_{\mathrm{priv}}^{-1}U^{-1} &= m
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, we've successfully recovered our message.
# Implementing the Cryptosystem (First Attempt)
## Imports
First, we will be importing the following libraries:
```python
import math
import numpy as np
import random
```

## Helper Functions
Before implementing the encryption scheme, we will need to construct some helper functions first.

To begin with, we note that we will be communicating in a language like English. However, GGH represents messages using integer vectors. So, the question arises: how can we encode English into integers? A natural approach then is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8" target="_blank">UTF-8 encoding <sup><i class='fas fa-external-link-alt arrow'></i></sup></a>, as seen below:

```python
def encode(message: str) -> list[int]:
    encoded = message.encode("utf8")
    return np.array(list(encoded))

def decode(message: list[int]) -> str:
    message_bytes = bytes(message)
    return message_bytes.decode("utf8")
```

Now that we've implemented a way to convert our messages into integer vectors (and vice versa), we will want to implement a few other helper functions that will be used in our encryption scheme. Namely, we will implement the following:
- Babai's Rounding Algorithm
- Unimodular Matrix Generation
- Hadamard Ratio Checker

```python
def babai_round(basis: np.array , vec: np.array) -> np.array:
        # To begin with, we will want to express vec in terms of our private basis B.
        coeffs = np.linalg.solve(np.transpose(basis), vec)
        # Next, we round each coefficient in coeffs to the nearest integer.
        rounded_coeffs = np.round(coeffs)
        # Now, we find the resulting closest vector.
        rounded_vec = rounded_coeffs @ basis

        return rounded_vec

def generate_unimodular(dimension:int, iters:int=-1) -> np.array:
    identity = np.eye(dimension, dtype=int)
    if iters == -1:
        iters = dimension**2 # Placeholder; will refine this more.

    for iter in range(iters):
        operation = random.randint(0, 2)
        # Picks indices to perform row operations on
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i == j:
            i = random.randint(0, dimension-1)
            j = random.randint(0, dimension-1)
        # Swap
        if operation == 0:
            identity[[i, j]] = identity[[j, i]]
        # Scaling
        elif operation == 1:
            multiplier = random.choice([-1, 1])
            identity[i] *= multiplier
        # Row Addition
        else:
            identity[i] += identity[j]
        identity = identity.astype(int)

    return identity

def hadamard_ratio(dimension:int, matrix:np.array) -> float:
    if matrix is None:
        return -1
    
    _, log_determinant = np.linalg.slogdet(matrix)
    determinant = np.exp(log_determinant)
    norms = np.prod(np.linalg.norm(matrix, ord=2, axis=1))
    ratio = (determinant / norms)**(1 / dimension)
    return ratio
```

For generating a unimodular matrix, we can start with the $n \times n$ identity matrix $I$. Then, for some number of iterations `iters`, we randomly select one of three operations to perform:
- Row Swap
- Row Scaling (by $1$ or $-1$)
- Row Addition

The idea then is that these operations will preserve the determinant of our identity matrix, and retains integer entries; thus, a unimodular matrix $U$ will be formed.

When verifying the Hadamard Ratio, due to how large our numbers can get, `numpy` can't handle calculating the determinant without experiencing overflow. As a result, we instead use `np.lingalg.slogdet()` rather than just directly using `np.linalg.det()`. Unfortunately, there will be a recurring theme of running into integer overflows or rounding-errors later on... but for now, let's continue with our implementation!

## Na&iuml;ve GGH
Now, we can start implementing the GGH cryptosystem. First, we will want to create a class for our `GGH` instance. As mentioned before, information that we will need are:
- Dimension (`int`): The dimension we are working in.
- $\sigma$ (`int`): The value that we will use for our error vector.

With that in mind, let us construct the class as follows:
```python
from Utils.utils import Utils

class GGH:
    def __init__(self, dimension:int, sigma:int=3, thresh:int=4):
        self.dimension = dimension
        self.sigma = sigma

        self.private_key = self.generate_private_key()
        self.unimodular = self.generate_unimodular()
        self.public_key = self.generate_public_key()

    def generate_private_key(self) -> np.array:
        ...
    
    def generate_unimodular(self) -> np.array:
        ...
    
    def generate_public_key(self) -> np.array:
        ...
    
    def encrypt(self, message:str) -> np.array:
        ...
    
    def decrypt(self, ciphertext:np.array) -> str:
        ...
```

We will now have to implement our key generation, which involves writing up code to generate our private key $K_{\mathrm{priv}}$, a random unimodular matrix $U$, and our public key $K_{\mathrm{pub}}$. This can be done as such:
```python
def generate_private_key(self) -> np.array:
        ...
    
def generate_unimodular(self) -> np.array:
    ...

def generate_public_key(self) -> np.array:
    ...
```
