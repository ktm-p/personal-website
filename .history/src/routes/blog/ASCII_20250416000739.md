# Introduction
If you've spent any time browsing the internet back in the early 2000's to 2010's, you've probably come across a number of ASCII images. For example, something like this:

![Portal Cake ASCII Art](/blog/ascii/portal-cake.png "Portal Cake ASCII Art")

While some images are simple and can probably be reconstructed by-hand, a lot of them are incredibly complex; I mean, there's no way somebody sat there and manually typed out something like the Mona Lisa, right? Obviously not -- clearly, there was some programming to convert these images into ASCII. Thus, curious about this process, I decided to tinker around and build my own ASCII converter.

For the rest of this post, I'll be detailing how I went about creating an ASCII converter, along with further improvements and optimizations done to the na&iumlve implementation.
