# Introduction
If you've spent any time browsing the internet back in the early 2000's, you've probably come across a number of ASCII images. While some images are simple and can probably be reconstructed by hand, others are incredibly complex; I mean, there's no way somebody sat there and manually typed out something like the Mona Lisa, right?

Obviously not -- clearly, there was some programming to convert these images into ASCII. Thus, curious about this process, I decided to tinker around and build my own ASCII converter.

For the rest of this post, I'll be detailing how I went about creating an ASCII converter, along with further improvements and optimizations done to the na&iumlve implementation. This includes adding in colour, speeding up the implementation, and also introducing edge detection to further refine the output.

# The Basic Idea
The core idea is that we want to replace each pixel with an ASCII character. The question then is what feature of the pixels do we want each character to convey. One natural feature is to try conveying the ``intensity" of a pixel -- that is, how bright a pixel is. We can extract the intensity $Y$ by converting our image to a grayscale version of itself using the following formula:
$$
Y = 0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B
$$
