# Introduction
Recently, I wrote a paper on a topic of interest for my Cryptography course. Seeing how present cryptosystems rely on the hardness of problems such as factoring and discrete-logarithm, both of which are cracked by Shor's algorithms, I decided to investigate (attempts at) Post-Quantum Cryptography. In particular, I explored an early lattice-based cryptosystem known as the Goldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi (GGH) Encryption Scheme. The paper can be read here <sup><i class='fas fa-external-link-alt arrow'></i></sup>.

Continuing from my paper, in this blog post I'll expand on it and implement both the cryptosystem itself, along with various attacks on it.

# Background
Before we dive into the implementation, we will provide a quick recap of relevant concepts for the cryptosystem along with the high-level overview of the scheme itself.

## Mathematical Prerequisites
First, we need to understand the notion of a "lattice" -- after all, this is what the entire cryptosystem relies on for its security! Here, we define an $n$-dimensional **lattice** $\mathcal{L}$ to be an integer linear combination of vectors:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L} = \left\{ \alpha_1v_1 + \cdots + \alpha_nv_n : \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}
\end{equation*}
$$

Another way to think of lattices is in terms of groups. Under a more group-theoretic perspective, lattices can be thought of as a group $\mathcal L$ satisfying the following two properties:
- **Additive Subgroup**
- **Discrete**: For each $g \in \mathcal L$, there exists an $\varepsilon$-neighborhood around them where there exists no other points.

Now, we call the set of linearly independent vectors which spans our lattice the **basis**. Notice that $\mathcal L$ can have infinitely many bases! An example of a lattice in the Euclidean plane can be seen below:

With this idea of bases, a natural question to ask is how we can differentiate between them. This is where the Hadamard Ratio comes in, which gives us a way to quantify the orthogonality of a chosen basis of $\mathcal L$:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal H(B) = \left( \frac{\det \mathcal L}{\lVert v_1\rVert \cdots \lvert v_n\rvert} \right)^{1/n}
\end{equation*}
$$

The closer this ratio is to $1$, the more orthogonal our basis is. From the figure above, we see that for our example lattice $\mathcal L$, the basis $\left\{u_1, u_2 \right\}$ is more orthogonal than $\left\{v_1, v_2 \right\}$; i.e. the Hadamard Ratio of the former basis is higher than the latter.

The last key idea related to different lattice bases is that of **unimodular matrices**. A unimodular matrix $U$ is defined as a matrix with integer-valued entries with a determinant of $\pm 1$. As it turns out, for some unimodular matrix $U$ and basis $B$ of a lattice $\mathcal L$, the product $UB$ is also a basis for $\mathcal L$; the operation preserves the underlying lattice structure. Intuitively, we can think of unimodular matrices as acting like a change-of-basis matrix.

## The Closest Vector Problem
With all of the mathematical prerequisites laid out, we can now discuss the crux of GGH's security: the Closest Vector Problem (CVP). Loosely speaking, the idea is that, given a lattice $\mathcal L$ and some arbitrary vector $v \in V$ (not necessarily part of our lattice), we want to find the closest lattice point to said vector.

As it turns out, without knowing extra information like the basis of $\mathcal L$, it is very difficult to find this closest vector point! As such, it is clear how this could serve as the starting point for an encryption scheme.

## The GGH Encryption Scheme
Now, we have all of the ingredients for constructing the GGH Encryption Scheme. First, we have the following:
